- Spring Framework 
- Dagger Framework 
- Mockito Framework

}

ðŸ”­Currently Working On {
- Iâ€™m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- Learning Python, a new dynamic programming language ( with the intention of widening my understanding of other non-static computer languages and their application in real life!)
- Liquid Template Language ( A template language used by Shopify)

}


Projects {
- Add in new Shop Features for a contract project, using Shopify's Liquid Template Files 
- Create an API Endpoint App, which takes in a User's birthdate and provides a corresponding Zodiac and Elemental. 

}

Interests {
- Learning new languages anad traveling to new countries to practice with locals (French, Spanish)
- Forest Bathing and Gardening.
- Having lots of bunnies
- Graphic Design! During the Pandemic I built up and opened a  Trans and Gender Non Conforming DesignHouse to support Trans online service providers, who struggled with niche saturation and invisibility online. I learned about entrepreneurial mindsets, and how to be of service to a community larger than just me!

ðŸ’¬Fun Facts {
-  My favorite Sport is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Growing up, I trained with the NYC Renzo Gracie Jiu Jitsu group and was a natural. It taught me am invaluable lesson - it doesn't matter how big/loud/bulky you are, to win, it's all about how smart, strategic and quick you are at landing the move! I take that with me in everything I do, still.
- Something I do every month without fail, is make a new music playlist, to set the tone for whatever phase I will be moving into. I am known by my partner and friends to be the playlist provider for any and all get togethers :D!
- ðŸ¤” Why did I choose this industry? I see an opportunity here for more diverse voices (specifically QTPOC) to be able to use their lived experiences and wisdom from life, to provide new age frameworks to leverage tech as a crisis averter, reducer of income/racial/quality-of-life worldwide!
