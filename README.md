🌌Projects {
- LABS Assignment App Creation: Built a Java application with
Spring Boot, Gradle, the MVC pattern
to create an Assignment reviewing app. Where users can submit their
assignments and view a collection of their due assignments, while,
learner assistants can submit feedback and review multiple users’
submitted assignments. Created a Service Class, Controller Class,
Repository Class and Entity classes.
- Zodiak App Creation: Making astrology simple to use and right at
your finger tips! Give the Zodiak App your birthdate
 and it will identify your Western Astrological zodiac sign and share some information about it! The Zodiak app, is an API Endpoint App, which takes in a
 User's birth day and month and provides a corresponding Zodiac/Elemental Sign and description.
- Sustainable Delivery Service:  Designed logic to route a customer's
order to the most strategic packaging/ shipping center, while considering
sustainability costs. To meet the sustainability goals of this delivery company,
I implemented new delivery packaging options with materials that had lower
scores on the sustanability index. Wrote out logic to apply different modes to determine the best route for a package considering different company goals.
Designed a blended strategy class to weigh carbon cost and
time expense when determining a customer’s most efficient shipping route.
- WebScraper to Accumulate Donation Links for a Humanitarian Cause: Used the Beautiful Soup library, and connected to Google Sheet's API to crawl through a webpage and find all direct donation links, store them in a list and then write these links to a google spreadsheet that is easily accessible. This project was another project demonstrating my learning process with Python.  
- Nickname Generator App Creation : Dabbled in Python to practice the
language with a fun interactive program, that offers a variety of new
nicknames for your chosen birthname. Has several modes *surprise me* ,
 *sillyName* , *simpleNickname*, take that to your friends!
Written as a terminal based program in Python.
