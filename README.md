🔭Currently Working On {
- I’m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language 
that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- Learning Python, a new dynamic programming language (with the intention of widening my understanding of
other non-static computer languages and their application in real life!)
- Liquid Template Language ( A template language used by Shopify)

}


🌌Projects {
- Add in new Shop Features for a contract project, using Shopify's Liquid Template Files 
- Create an API Endpoint App, which takes in a User's birthdate and provides a corresponding Zodiac and Elemental.

🌈Interests {
- Learning new languages anad traveling to new countries to practice with locals (French, Spanish)
- Forest Bathing and Gardening
- Taking care of my little bunnies
- Graphic Design! During the Pandemic I built up and opened a Trans and Gender Non Conforming DesignHouse to support Trans entrepreneurs and
service providers, who struggled with market saturation and invisibility online. 
Founding 'Trans Brands' I learned about *growth mindset*, entrepreneurial drive (_if you can think it, you can make it_)
and how enriching it can be to learn a skill and use it to help support others' dreams!

💬Fun Facts {
-  My favorite sport is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Growing up, I trained with the NYC Renzo Gracie Jiu Jitsu group and it just clicked.
It taught me discipline, and an invaluable lesson: To win, it doesn't matter how big/loud/bulky you are, 
it's always about how smart, strategic and quick you are in landing your move! Commit completely!  
- Every month, I curate a new themed playlist to match whatever season I feel I am in. 
I find it helps me feel motivated and sets the tone of whatever phase/goal I am striving to move through.
This is why, in my friend groups I tend to be the designated-dj at any function!😝
- Why'd I choose this industry? I see an opportunity here for more diverse voices (specifically QTPOC) 
to be able to use their lived experiences and wisdom from life, to weigh into this new age of tech and emerging frameworks. I do believe 
we can leverage tech as a resolver of many human caused ecological and social crises.
