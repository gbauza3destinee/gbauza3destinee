### Hey There, 🚀 I’m Des!
I am a multi-creative passionate from New York City, now based around the world.
My dream is to use my skills to be of great service to all humans and our planet! 

```yaml



🌱 Technologies{
- Java Language 
- Spring Framework 
- Dagger Framework 
- Mockito Framework
- JUNIT5 Testing
- DynamoDB Database
- AWS Lambda Functions 
- AWS CloudFormation 

}

🔭Currently Working On {
- I’m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- Learning Python, a new dynamic programming language ( with the intention of widening my understanding of other non-static computer languages and their application in real life!)
- Liquid Template Language ( A template language used by Shopify)

}


🌌Projects {
- Add in new Shop Features for a contract project, using Shopify's Liquid Template Files 
- Create an API Endpoint App, which takes in a User's birthdate and provides a corresponding Zodiac and Elemental. 

}

🤩Interests {
- Learning new languages anad traveling to new countries to practice with locals (French, Spanish)
- Forest Bathing and Gardening.
- Having lots of bunnies
- Graphic Design! During the Pandemic I built up and opened a Trans and Gender Non Conforming DesignHouse to support Trans entrepreneurs and
service providers, who struggled with market saturation and invisibility online. 
Founding 'Trans Brands' I learned about *growth mindset*, entrepreneurial drive (_if you can think it, you can make it_)
and how enriching it can be to learn a skill and use it to help support others' dreams!

💬Fun Facts {
-  My favorite sport is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Growing up, I trained with the NYC Renzo Gracie Jiu Jitsu group and it just clicked.
It taught me discipline, and an invaluable lesson: To win, it doesn't matter how big/loud/bulky you are, it's always about how smart, strategic and quick you are in landing your move! Commit completely!  
- I love spotify playlists, and routinely every month I curate a themed playlist, to match whatever season I feel I am in. 
It helps me set the tone for what phase I am in. And it is often used as a dj set for any friend get togethers. I tend to be the designated dj.😝
- Why'd I choose this industry? I see an opportunity here for more diverse voices (specifically QTPOC) to be able to use their lived experiences and wisdom from life, to provide new age frameworks to leverage tech as a crisis averter, reducer of income/racial/quality-of-life worldwide!
