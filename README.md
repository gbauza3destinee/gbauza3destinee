### Hey There, ðŸš€ Iâ€™m Des!
I am a multi-creative passionate from New York City, now based around the world.
My dream is to use my skills to be of great service to all humans and our planet! 

```yaml



ðŸŒ± Technologies{
- Java Language 
- Spring Framework 
- Dagger Framework 
- Mockito Framework
- JUNIT5 Testing
- DynamoDB Database
- AWS Lambda Functions 
- AWS CloudFormation 

}

ðŸ”­Currently Working On {
- Iâ€™m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- Learning Python, a new dynamic programming language ( with the intention of widening my understanding of other non-static computer languages and their application in real life!)
- Liquid Template Language ( A template language used by Shopify)

}


ðŸŒŒProjects {
- Add in new Shop Features for a contract project, using Shopify's Liquid Template Files 
- Create an API Endpoint App, which takes in a User's birthdate and provides a corresponding Zodiac and Elemental. 

}

ðŸ¤©Interests {
- Learning new languages anad traveling to new countries to practice with locals (French, Spanish)
- Forest Bathing and Gardening.
- Having lots of bunnies
- Graphic Design! During the Pandemic I built up and opened a Trans and Gender Non Conforming DesignHouse to support Trans entrepreneurs and
service providers, who struggled with market saturation and invisibility online. 
Founding 'Trans Brands' I learned about *growth mindset*, entrepreneurial drive (_if you can think it, you can make it_)
and how enriching it can be to learn a skill and use it to help support others' dreams!

ðŸ’¬Fun Facts {
-  My favorite sport is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Growing up, I trained with the NYC Renzo Gracie Jiu Jitsu group and was a natural. It taught me discipline, and another invaluable lesson: _it doesn't matter how big/loud/bulky you are_, to win, it's about how smart, strategic and quick you are at landing your move! I take that with me in everything I do, til this day.
- Every month I make a special themed music playlist, to match whatever season I feel I am in. It helps me set the tone for what
phase I am in. I am also known by my partner and friends to be the playlist dj for all get togethers, as I have such diverse vibed playlists haha :D!
- Why'd I choose this industry? I see an opportunity here for more diverse voices (specifically QTPOC) to be able to use their lived experiences and wisdom from life, to provide new age frameworks to leverage tech as a crisis averter, reducer of income/racial/quality-of-life worldwide!
