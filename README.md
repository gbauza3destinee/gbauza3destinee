### Hey There, ðŸš€ðŸš€Iâ€™m Des :) 

I love to explore uncharted territories, and learn from cultural traditions

- ðŸ¤” Why I chose this industry I see the opportunity to 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about dynamic programming languages such as Python, so that I can widen my understanding of more computer language frameworks within the big world of Computer Science!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on eco-friendly, Indigenous language learning, and socially conscious programs!


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My most recent seasonal music playlist- I love to create a friend-favorite seasonal playlist, curated with the newest, most diverse feel-good songs from multiple languages.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I trained with Renzo Gracie Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I loved it because itâ€™s not about how big or strong you are- but about how smart and fast you move! I take this into my life as a lesson, to this day.
