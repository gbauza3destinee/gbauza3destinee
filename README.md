### Hey There, ðŸš€ðŸš€Iâ€™m Des :) `#C0CA33`


I love to explore uncharted territories, ideate humanitarian solutions and learn as I travel from many different cultural traditions!

- ðŸ¤” Why I chose this industry I see an opportunity for more diverse voices (specifically QTPOC) to be able to use their lived experiences and outlook on life, to provide new age frameworks for solving crises and reducing gaps in wealth, health, and quality of life!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing projects using Java Language, a static language that I have been studying for over a year in the BloomTech Backend program.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about dynamic programming languages such as Python, so that I can widen my understanding of more computer language frameworks within the big world of Computer Science!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on eco-friendly, Indigenous language learning, and socially conscious programs!


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My most recent seasonal music playlist- I love to create a friend-favorite seasonal playlist, curated with the newest, most diverse feel-good songs from multiple languages.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I trained with Renzo Gracie Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I loved it because itâ€™s not about how big or strong you are- but about how smart and fast you move! I take this into my life as a lesson, to this day.
